# PokeML
Exploring data science through Pokemon

This project is the programming sibling to the articles on PokeML I have created on Medium (https://medium.com/@patrickmartinaz/pokeml-an-introduction-to-data-science-using-pokemon-c5df8d6decd0)
These notebooks show how the quantitative and qualitative results described in the article were actually found, and allow you to play around with the datasets yourself.

This project (and the associated Medium articles) intends to go through a variety of data science techniques, including PCA, topic modeling, neural networks, and others.
I hope you enjoy exploring this novel dataset!

The Pokemon datasets in this project were compiled from data from Pokemon Showdown (https://pokemonshowdown.com/) and Smogon (https://www.smogon.com/).
